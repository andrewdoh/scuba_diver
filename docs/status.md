##Technical Description:
  When we first began formulating an idea for the project, we initially wanted to teach an AI archery using a combination of multiple neural networks. However after consulting with the professor for the first time, we realize how unfeasible our initial idea was. So, we decided to change our project completely. Our new project used an agent to explore a 3D underwater maze. Unlike like the assignment that was done in the class, our project involves two key differences. The first being that to navigate a 3D maze, we must allow the agent to move in 3 dimensions. Instead of having the 4 standard states (forward, backward, left, right), we now have 6 states which includes moving up and moving down. The second major difference is that we introduced a new resource that needs to be managed by the agent in the form of air. Now the agent has to map out a route that includes enough air for it to reach the goal without drowning. The environment that the agent will be tested in has a total of 6 floors. Currently, our group is testing the AI with only two floors enabled because it is more effecient for testing our algorithm and it has a state space large enough for us to understand its scale but small enough so that it won't take us a long time to get the agent to final goal.
