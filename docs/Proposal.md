##Summary:
The main idea for our project is to teach our agent how to fire an arrow at a target given various circumstances. The environment in whicb the agent will be operating in will change to make it more difficult for the agent to accomplish the stated goal. For example in one of our testing environment, the agent will have to shoot a moving enemy and through observing the patterns of the mobs' movements will the agent achieve a higher accuracy percentage. The input that the agents will take in will be its starting position and the targets position and the output that the agent will produce is the angle at which the arrows will hit the provided target the most. 

##AI/ML Algoritms:
We will be planning to use MDPs.

##Evaluation Plan:
The end goal of this project is that we can develop an agent that can shoot a moving target given that the target is within a reasonable distance.
